# thewatercooler
My first full-stack application, sorta insta-clone, but on it you post the current tv show that you are watching. You can see what your friend's are enjoying, give them recommendations, and just be kept up to speed. Purpose is to eliminate the question of asking a tedious, "What are you watching these days?" **You'll just know.**

Brought to you by NextJS, TailwindCSS (DaisyUI), HTML, a splash of MongoDB, a little bit of AWS S3, and deployed on Vercel.

One day I was watching a video of Marc Lou talking about his money-generating webapps and it sincerely inspired me to just code more, even while working. As a friend said it best, if you go home and do nothing, 5 years will go by and you're still in the same place. Thus, thewatercooler.

I gave myself a couple of weeks to build something and that'd be the amount of time allotted to this project. I worked on it from July 2024 - Sept 2024.
